## 📘 Project Overview
The **Secure Chat Application** is a **real-time encrypted messaging system** built with "Python Flask" and "Flask-SocketIO".  
It uses **AES-based end-to-end encryption** (via CryptoJS) to ensure that all messages are secure and private — the server never sees plaintext messages.  

This project demonstrates **secure, real-time communication** with a clean GUI and is suitable as a foundation for building secure chat or IoT communication tools.
